# keyboard-helper

> A side project designed for Zoe to learn the keyboard.

## TODO
Make it reactive, currently the CSS on it isn't very good.
Add a toggle to disable the audio.
Add a toggle to change from uppercase display to lowercase.
Add logic to filter out all other keys except letters and space.

## Nice TODO
When a word is spelt out, return an image.  Example: spell "cat" display a cat pic.
